        <h2>Danielle's words</h2>

        <p>
          To say that Andrew came into my life unexpectedly is the
          understatement of the century. My dating life had become so
          complicated (only to be further complicated by COVID) that I had
          resolutely decided to go on a long-term dating sabbatical. You know
          what they say, as soon as you stop looking for it, you find it!
        </p>

        <p>
          Having known Andrew for 5+ years, and despite my brother’s
          occasional hints that I should date and marry Andrew, it seemed
          unlikely that anything would ever blossom between us. I am not going
          to lie, at first it was really hard to open myself up to dating
          someone again, least of all my brother’s best friend, but Andrew
          kept surprising me. He was so kind and tender that he melted my
          bitter, lonely heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before I knew it, I had fallen head-over-heels in love with Andrew.
          His kindness, bravery, maturity and yes, his awkward dancing in the
          grocery store, won me over.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love how effortlessly thoughtful he is, and how humility and
          empathy just seem to be part of his inherent nature. There isn’t a
          hint of guile in him and I trust him more than I ever thought
          possible. He has stood by my side during some of my hardest moments,
          and has made me laugh (as well as \face-palm) the rest of the time.
          I am so excited to be marrying Andrew and I look forward to all of
          our future adventures!
        </p>

      <div id="andrew">
        <h2>Thoughts from Andrew</h2>

        <p>
          One of the first conversations that Danielle and I had in our
          relationship, was what it meant to grow old together. We both agreed
          that one has to have a willingness to be <em>always</em> by the
          other's side, no matter what they are going through. Luckily, I feel
          like I have gotten to know Danielle well enough that I want to be by
          her side. By being by her side and supporting her, I know I can
          contribute to us growing old together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is what I know of Danielle. She is such an ambitious person. I
          admire her greatly for all the things she wants to do. To feed her
          ambition, she has an incredible work ethic.
          <em>Danielle wants to make a difference</em>. There are important
          attributes that Danielle exhibits. She is caring and loving towards
          those that might feel rejected. Because of that, she has a golden
          heart. I feel like she knows what it means to have a successful
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been able to see fruit from my relationship with Danielle. We
          like to visit and be around people. By visiting with people
          together, we are able to give other people attention. That way,
          people know they have a friend in us. We like to be ambitious
          together. We do dream in our own different realms of potential
          influence. We are, as Danielle would say, intellectually discontent
          with the little knowledge that we have. We are very open to
          challenging ideas and to learning more about life. We love to have
          fun, laugh, and dance; even if I am no where near as skilled a
          dancer like Danielle! There have been a variety of activities that
          we have tried, and we have come out enjoying just about all of them.
          Danielle enjoys those activities too, speaking of which, I
          absolutely love seeing her big and wide smile when she is having
          fun! It is clearly obvious to me that we have an effective
          relationship!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am humbled at the thought to be with her, <em>in eternity</em>.
          From the time that we have been together, I know that we can work
          together. We can work together because we are willing to listen and
          teach the other in the relationship. I am confident in our ability
          to stay together.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, yes, I love Danielle very much.</p>

        <h2 id="wedding-day">Wedding Day</h2>

        <p>
          Due to the present COVID pandemic, precautions will be taken into
          account to reduce disease spread. It is because of this that we will
          be limiting our celebrations to close friends and family only. 
          We hope to celebrate with all of you in the future when the world
          is a little safer!
        </p>

        <p>
          We have had many questions about our wedding day. We will be sealed
          the morning of the 28th for time and all eternity in the Jordan River
          Temple. For the sake of keeping things safe and simple, we will be having
          an intimate luncheon that afternoon, then will leave for our honeymoon
          in Cancun, Mexico the next morning. 
        </p>

        </p>
    
        <p>
          For an opportunity to meet the couple, there will be a socially-distanced 
          picnic-meet-and-greet on May 20th at Bywater Park from 5:30 - 8:30 pm. 
          Please contact Danielle or Andrew for more details.
        </p>
