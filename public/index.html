          <!-- <p>
            As time passed early on in the relationship, Danielle and Andrew
            developed a firm and solid friendship. They learned how to enjoy
            spending time with each other by discussing a variety of topics that
            would encourage them to learn more about life!
          </p>

          <p>
            Danielle and Andrew decided to do something big together. They
            traveled Zion National Park to camp and to hike! This would be a
            good indicator for if Danielle and Andrew could spend constant time
            around each other. And it was a success!
          </p>

          <p>
            Andrew bought his first Christmas tree and even a mistletoe to
            celebrate the holidays with Danielle.
          </p>

          <p>
            By an unfortunate accident, Danielle broke her ankle while ice
            skating. That was her third time ice skating, but it was Andrew's
            first time ice skating. Andrew saw this as an important time to
            build the relationship even further.
          </p>

          <p>
            With Danielle's foot broken, Danielle and Andrew were still able to
            find ways to do creative activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Near the end of December 2020, Danielle and Andrew knew they wanted
            to get married. So they started to have serious discussions and
            questions on how a marriage would look. They also had discussions
            with goals that they could have individually and together. With
            these discussions, Danielle and Andrew gained more and more
            confidence in their commitment to each other.

          <h2>Thoughts from Danielle</h2>

          <p>Being written... come back later!</p>
        </div>

        <div id="andrew">
          <h2>Thoughts from Andrew</h2>

          <p>
            One of the first conversations that Danielle and I had in our
            relationship, was what it meant to grow old together. We both agreed
            that one has to have a willingness to be <em>always</em> by the
            other's side, no matter what they are going through. Luckily, I feel
            like I have gotten to know Danielle well enough that I want to be by
            her side. By being by her side and supporting her, I know I can
            contribute to us growing old together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is what I know of Danielle. She is such an ambitious person. I
            admire her greatly for all the things she wants to do. To feed her
            ambition, she has an incredible work ethic.
            <em>Danielle wants to make a difference</em>. There are important
            attributes that Danielle exhibits. She is caring and loving towards
            those that might feel rejected. Because of that, she has a golden
            heart. I feel like she knows what it means to have a successful
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been able to see fruit from my relationship with Danielle. We
            like to visit and be around people. By visiting with people
            together, we are able to give other people attention. That way,
            people know they have a friend in us. We like to be ambitious
            together. We do dream in our own different realms of potential
            influence. We are, as Danielle would say, intellectually discontent
            with the little knowledge that we have. We are very open to
            challenging ideas and to learning more about life. We love to have
            fun, laugh, and dance; even if I am no where near as skilled a
            dancer like Danielle! There have been a variety of activities that
            we have tried, and we have come out enjoying just about all of them.
            Danielle enjoys those activities too, speaking of which, I
            absolutely love seeing her smile big and wide when she is having
            fun. I know that we enjoy being around each other!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am humbled at the thought to be with her, <em>forever</em>. From
            the time that we have been together, I know that we can work
            together. We can work together because we are willing to listen and
            teach the other in the relationship. I am confident in our ability
            to stay together.
          </p>
          <p>In the end, yes, I love Danielle very much.</p>
