        <blockquote>
          <p>
            One of the first conversations that Danielle and I had in our
            relationship, was what it meant to grow old together. We both agreed
            that one has to have a willingness to be <em>always</em> be by the
            other's side, no matter what they are going through. Luckily, I feel
            like I have gotten to know Danielle well enough that I want to be by
            her side. By being by her side, I want her to succeed and live life
            to its fullest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is what I know of Danielle. She is such an ambitious person. I
            admire her greatly for all the things she wants to do. To summarize
            what she wants to do, <em>she wants to make a difference.</em> There
            are important attributes that Danielle exhibits in order to make a
            difference. She is caring and loving towards those that might feel
            rejected. Because of that, she has a golden heart. She is able to
            plan and to anticipate details, in which I admittedly lack. This
            attribute has saved me several times.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am humbled at the thought to be with her, <em>forever.</em> From
            the time that we have been together, I know that we can work
            together. We can work together because we are willing to listen and
            teach the other in the relationship. I am confident in our ability
            to stay together.
          </p>
          <p>In the end, yes, I love Danielle very much.</p>
